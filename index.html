<blockquote>
<p>“No one told me that when i left home, the sounds of that particular past - during the formation of childhood and youth - would come back to haunt me; a distant call to return. And when that finally happened, the sounds had changed in its entirety - the familiar now an alien(ised) auditory landscape.
To end the haunting was not possible - it never was to begin with.”

<p><strong><em>LAGU MADU</em></strong> aims to appease this eldritch phenomena by playing a procedurally composed ambient soundtrack formed of sounds and field recordings by urban creatures and local wildlife.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p><strong><em>LAGU MADU</em></strong> makes a comparison between the forced migration of fauna by violent displacement and the artist&#39;s own story of migrating to the UK by recreating the echoes from their past in Singapore combined with the now in Bradford.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>It attempts to call attention to the disappearing sounds of nature and to reflect on the broader issue of biodiversity loss and the impact of human activities on the environment.
<br/>

<p><strong><em>LAGU</em></strong>  - a song<br><strong><em>MADU</em></strong> - honey(pot)
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>It is an invocation for the past to reclaim the future.
