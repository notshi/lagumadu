> “No one told me that when i left home, the sounds of that particular past - during the formation of childhood and youth - would come back to haunt me; a distant call to return. And when that finally happened, the sounds had changed in its entirety - the familiar now an alien(ised) auditory landscape.
> To end the haunting was not possible - it never was to begin with.”

**_LAGU MADU_** aims to appease this eldritch phenomena by playing a procedurally composed ambient soundtrack formed of sounds and field recordings by urban creatures and local wildlife.


**_LAGU MADU_** makes a comparison between the forced migration of fauna by violent displacement and the artist's own story of migrating to the UK by recreating the echoes from their past in Singapore combined with the now in Bradford.


It attempts to call attention to the disappearing sounds of nature and to reflect on the broader issue of biodiversity loss and the impact of human activities on the environment.


**_LAGU_**  - a song  
**_MADU_** - honey(pot)


It is an invocation for the past to reclaim the future.
